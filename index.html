                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Algeria , officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb
                        region of North Africa. The capital and most populous city is Algiers, located in the far north
                        of the country on the Mediterranean coast. With an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres, Algeria
                        is the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest by area in the African Union and the
                        Arab world. With an estimated population of over 44 million, it is the eighth-most populous
                        country in Africa.

                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Since the 2011 breakup of Sudan, Algeria has been the largest country in Africa, and the
                        Mediterranean Basin. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara. To the
                        north, the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs
                        in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas
                        tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the
                        entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is
                        Mount Tahat (3,003 metres or 9,852 feet).</p>

                    <h2>Economy</h2>
                    <p>Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the World Bank. Algeria's currency is
                        the dinar (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist
                        post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the
                        privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign
                        involvement in its economy. These restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently
                        although questions about Algeria's slowly-diversifying economy remain.

                    <h2>Tourism</h2>
                    <p>The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of
                        facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting
                        in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.
                        There are several UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Algeria including Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad, the
                        first capital of the Hammadid empire; Tipasa, a Phoenician and later Roman town; and Dj√©mila and
                        Timgad, both Roman ruins; M'Zab Valley, a limestone valley containing a large urbanized oasis;
                        and the Casbah of Algiers, an important citadel. The only natural World Heritage Site is the
                        Tassili n'Ajjer, a mountain range.</p>
